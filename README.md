# Advanced Topics in Computer Science Honors (Data Structures and Algorithms)

My Java programs from the Advanced Topics in Computer Science Honors course at my high school. 
Note: This contains code from my course. This repository is not intended for cheating or copying code. This is simply for reference and for learning purposes. Any violation of academic integrity off this code is not intended and the creator of this repository is not to be blamed for.
If you utilize this repository to blindly copy-paste code for repeated assignments, you are only cheating yourself out of learning.

#### **Here are the highlights/assignments from each unit:**

## Unit 11: Heaps
- Heaps are Trees, but unlike Binary Seach Trees, they are array-based — with either the min or max value at the root.
- Implemented min-heap (smallest value at the root)
- Implemented max-heap (largest value at the root)

## Unit 10: Trees
- Notable projects include: 
  - Implemented a `Tree` class from scratch with a custom-built `TreeNode` class
  - Wrote methods to add a `Node` to a BST, in order 
  - Wrote methods to remove a `Node` from a binary tree
  - Wrote methods to find if a node/value is in a specific binary tree
  - Wrote methods to print binary tree in in-order, pre-order, post-order, and reverse-order
  - Wrote methds to find: 
    - Tree width
    - Number of levels in a binary tree
    - Smallest value  a binary tree
    - Largest value  a binary tree
    - Number of leaves in a binary tree
    - Number of nodes in a binary tree
    - If the tree is or is not full and complete
  - Modeled Histograms with custom binary `Tree`s and `TreeNode`s

## Unit 9: HashMaps and HashSets
- Notable projects include: 
  - HashCodes
  - HashTables
  - Words
  - Wrestler and Wrestling Team
  - School Club Mapping
  - HashPhone

- Notable projects include: 
  - Made a spanish-to-english dictionary mapping from a give `.dat` file
  - Modeled Histogram
  - Modeled Relatives
  - Modeled Acronyms
  - Modeled Autoparts
  - Modeled `Student`s with a `Student` grade `Map`

## Unit 7: `Set`s
- Notable projects include: 
  - Implemented a `Set` from scratch
  - Found Uniques and Dupes (Duplicates) with and without `iterator`s
  - Modeled a Coin Collection
  - Implemented `MathSet` with union, intersection, symmetric diff and delta operators

## Unit 6: Prioirity `Queue`s
- Notable projects include: 
  - Writing `toString()`, `getMin()`, and `getNaturalOrder()` methods for PQ
  - Modeled Swimmers with a PQ
  - Modeled a Liver Transplant with a PQ
  - Circular Array with a PQ

## Unit 5: `Queue`s
- Notable projects include: 
  - Implemented a `Queue` from scratch
  - Implemented Circular `Queue` from scratch
  - Developed various methods to append, clone, reverse, and alternate, value in a `Queue`

## Unit 4: Stacks
- Notable projects include: 
  - Utilized functions such as pop to demonstrate how a Stack works with the analogy of a pile of books
  - Reversed digits with a Stack
  - Reversed a String with a Stack
  - Modeled a single-lane driveway with a Stack
  - Created a Deck of Cards in a Stack and developed numerous shuffle methods
  - Made a program that evaluates algebraic expressions (in PEMDAS-order) with a Stack

## Unit 3: `LinkedList`s
- Notable projects include: 
  - Implemented `LinkedList` from scratch with a provided `ListNode` class
  - Operated through `LinkedList`s with an `iterator` 
  - Modeled fruits with `LinkedList`s
  - Modeled polynomials with `LinkedList`s
  - Modeled a restaurant with a singly `LinkedList`, implementing various methods 
  - Create letter and letter counts to represent a histogram of data
  - Implemented Doubly `LinkedList`s from my own `ListNode` class

## Unit 2: Sorts and Searching
- Discussed and researched efficiency through Big-O notation and various algorithms and operations and each of their respective time complexities. Notable labs include: [Quadratic Sort Lab](https://github.com/rsha256/ATCS/blob/master/SortsAndSearch/Quadratic%20Sort%20Lab.pdf)\*:
  - Create 3 graphs using data from using  bubble sort  on 1) an array in random order, 2) an array in descending order, and 3) an array in order.
  - Create 3 graphs using data from using  insertion  sort  on 1) an array in random order, 2) an array in descending order, and 3) an array in order.
  - Create 3 graphs using data from using  selection  sort  on 1) an array in random order, 2) an array in descending order, and 3) an array in order.
  - Create a chart and graph for a random array using 3 different sorts.
  - Create a chart and graph for an ordered array using 3 different sorts.
  - Create a chart and graph for an array in descending order for 3 different sorts.
  - Explain why these are called quadratic sorts. Use the O(n²) notation in your response.
  - Which is the most efficient sort of a random array? Why? Which is the least efficient sort of a reverse ordered array? Why?
  - Which of these sort situations will produce a linear relationship O(n).  Why?

\* Received perfect score.
