# Advanced Topics in Computer Science Honors ()Data Structures and Algorithms)

My Java programs from the Advanced Topics in Computer Science Honors course at my high school. 
Note: This contains code from my course. This repository is not intended for cheating or copying code. This is simply for reference and for learning purposes. Any violation of academic integrity off this code is not intended and the creator of this repository is not to be blamed for.
If you utilize this repository to blindly copy-paste code for repeated assignments, you are only cheating yourself out of learning.

* Here are the highlights/assignments from each unit:

## Unit 12
- Final Project: Java FX Music Store

## Unit 11
- LoanCalculator (JavaFX)

## Unit 10
- Introduction to JavaFX

## Unit 9
- Multithreading in Java to find a number

## Unit 8
- A Contact JavaBean (the program is Serializable so that it can write the contacts to either a txt or dat file)

## Unit 7
- I made a Serializable gpa calculator that writes to a binary file

## Unit 6
- Song list: I made a song processor to read and write objects to and from a binary file

## Unit 5
- Song list: I made a song processor to read and write objects to and from a text file

## Unit 4
- I worked with try and catch blocks to allow someone to throw exceptions a certain number of times

## Unit 3: LinkedLists
- Implemented LinkedLists from scratch, operated through LinkedLists with an iterator 

## Unit 2: Sorts and Searching
- Discussed and researched efficiency through Big-O notation and various algorithms and operations and each of their respective time complexities. Notable projects include: Quadratic Sort Lab:
** Create 3 graphs using data from using  bubble sort  on 1) an array in random order, 2) an array in descending order, and 3) an array in order.
** Create 3 graphs using data from using  insertion  sort  on 1) an array in random order, 2) an array in descending order, and 3) an array in order.
** Create 3 graphs using data from using  selection  sort  on 1) an array in random order, 2) an array in descending order, and 3) an array in order.
** Create a chart and graph for a random array using 3 different sorts.
** Create a chart and graph for an ordered array using 3 different sorts.
** Create a chart and graph for an array in descending order for 3 different sorts.
** Explain why these are called quadratic sorts. O(nÂ²)
** Which is the most efficient sort of a random array?  Why?  Which is the least efficient sort of a reverse ordered array?  Why?
** Which of these sort situations will produce a linear relationship   O(n).  Why?

Received perfect score.

## Unit 1: Recursion
- Notable projects include: Letter Pemutations, General Recursion Methods, Counting Letters in a Grid, Maze, and Game of Chess.
